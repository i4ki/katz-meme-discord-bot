# katz-meme-discord-bot

A simple Discord bot that responds to the `/katz-meme <name>` command by checking if the
requested meme exists in the [Katcipis Golden Meme Repository](https://github.com/katcipis/memes).

If the meme is found, the bot sends the corresponding image to the channel or direct message where
the command was used.

That's it.

NOW AI DO IT!!!
